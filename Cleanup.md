# Methods
## 1. Search for bacterial sequences
All sequences were searched against Uniref90 (release September 19, 2017) using DIAMOND aligner (with --sensitive setting, bit score cutoff of 100). A script was used to find all sequences whose best hit in the database is to a bacterial sequence and with more than 90% similarity. The source (MMETSP ID) of these sequences and the taxonomy of the corresponding bacterial sequences were analyzed.
## 2. Search for protistan secondary sequences
An all-vs-all protein search was conducted against the entire protein dataset itself using DIAMOND with the same cutoffs. Only hits with more than 90% similarity were kept. Hits between sequences from the same phylum were not further analyzed. Highly similar sequences from samples of different phyla were counted. 
# Findings
## 1. Bacterial sequences
The assumption here is a sequence is probably of bacterial origin if its best hit in the Uniref90 database is a bacterial sequence and it is more than 90% similar to that (since Uniref90 is generated by clustering all Uniref sequences at 90% similarity). I found 21 MMETSP samples with more than 3% bacterial sequences (see table below). Many of the bacterial sources are known marine bacteria, but strangely, Pelomonas, which is not known to be found in marine environments, were found to be in many samples. About half of these samples were of Heterosigma akashiwo, but others have no relation with H. akashiwo, and were produced by different labs. Not all H. akashiwo samples have this Pelomonas. Furthermore, these Pelomonas sequences were often found in many samples (on average 5.5 samples). Later, I would also find that these samples with Pelomonas all share a large number of sequences with each other (see section 2 below). Therefore, it is highly likely these Pelomonas sequences are from a systemic contamination at the sequencing center rather than native bacteria in the cultures.
